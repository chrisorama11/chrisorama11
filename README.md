## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris, welcome to my Github!

I'm a final year Mechatronics and Biomedical Engineering student at McMaster University. I'm constantly trying to learn and build new things. When I'm not learning or building, you can probably find me watching a movie, playing pickup basketball, or listening to good music.
